# The-Tortoise-and-The-Hare
 Written in C, this program is based off the story the Tortoise and the Hare, but with some twist. In this program there are obstacles like carrots, a stream, and rocks. Each character moves at random and who reaches the end of the race first wins or if there is a tie, who ever moved the farthest wins.
